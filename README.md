# platform-man
Messing around / 2d platformer / design / js practice.

A project I started to improve my comfort level with javascript and learn a thing or two about game engines. I wanted to get more familiar with several different aspects of javascript such that I would have a better idea of when to utilize the many different object types / different strategies for structuring and organizing code.

I also wanted to try writing a platformer from scratch. The material result was pretty 'meh' haha, but it was super fun working on something totally new to me, and getting to try out different ideas for things like collision detection definitely exercised a different part of my brain.
